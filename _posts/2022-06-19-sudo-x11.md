1. Make sure x11 is working in normal user.
```
xclock
```
A clock window should be shown.
If not, X11 forwarding may be not enabled in ssh.
`ssh -X` not used?

2. Get X authorization entry for current display
```
$ xauth list $DISPLAY
host/unix:10  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  742d024faeb3d29a15ff06f1b8c3b21e
```

3. Add X authorization entry for root
```
# Execute as normal user
$ sudo xauth add host/unix:10  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  742d024faeb3d29a15ff06f1b8c3b21e
```

4. Run x11 as root
```
sudo env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY xclock
``` 
A clock window should be shown.
