I have never thought that I fully understand the meaning of `Memory ordering`
Here is some resources to help me understand

- [Atomic Chapter in the Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/atomics.html): Simple introduction for ordering
- [Rust Atomics and Locks](https://marabos.nl/atomics/): Very awesome book for currency. Must read
